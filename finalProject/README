I.Description:
This program finish all requirement in pa4. Experiments in experiments folder, new filter in the newfilter folder

II.Usage:
a)make
	make
b)run with normal filter
	./filt <filtfile> <imagefile> [outputfile]
or with gabor filter
	./filt -g <theta> <sigma> <period> <imagefile> [outputfile]

ps. <> is required, [] is optional, add "-t" to output file without displaying.
	
	when the program is running, use the following command
		key 'c' to apply filter to the current result image
		key 'r' to reset the image to the original image
		key 'w' to write result to file, if no output filename is desinated, writing will fail ,error massage will be shown
		key 'q' or ESC to quit 
	advanced:
		key 'u' to undo.
	
c)to generate experiment results, after make, run experiment.sh
	chmod +x experiment.sh
	./experiment.sh

III.Code Structure:
	There are 5 classes, they are Manager FileIO MyImage Filter ImageProcess.
		Manager		manage all resource including MyImage and Filter and ImageProcess. It also parse argument and interact with main function.
		FileIo 		read from file to modify a MyImage or a Filter.
		MyImage 	store data and properties of a image.
		Filter 		store data and properties of a Filter. 
		ImageProcess	 Process MyImage by using Filters.

	requirement:
		IO 			basically done by singleton class FileIO
		display, 	object of MyImage could output its data to desinated displayingbuffer
		convolve 	done by ImageProcess, in applyFilterTo(MyImage& m, Filter f) function.
		boundary, 	using reflection to handle boundary
		scaling, 	done when reading the Filter file.
		normalization then convole result will be store in a float array instead of a unsigned char array, so data could be normalize based on the range of computed result.
		experiment, see the script, after running the script, the result will be stored in experiments folder
		new filter  see newfilter folder
		gaborfilter implemented in ImageProcess::applyGaborFilterto(), first, it generats a Filter, then call applyFilterTo().

IV.Experiment
	After running the .sh file, experiment results will be saved in four folders named 1, 2, 3, gabor respectively.
	Experiment 1
		the image is blurred, different filter resulted in different edge.
	Experiment 2
		the image's gradient feature is shown
	Experiment 3
		donut.filt make the image blurred with a donut edge, while the star.filt blurred the image with a star edge.
	gabor
		outline of the toothbrush is shown.

V.Known bugs
	when running with "-g" argument and the "-g <theta> <sigma> <period>" is not in the end of command, lack of parameter will not be detected. For example: "./filt imagefile -g 4 4" will prompt help info while "./filt -g 4 4 imagefile" will just keep running forever.

VI.Attribution
	Makefile is originally writen by DJ, I made some modification on it to fit this project.
