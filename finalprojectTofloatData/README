6040 final project

II.Usage:
a)make
	make
b)run
	./adbrush inputimage outputimage
	
	keyboard
		1 adjust brightness 
		2 adjust saturation
		3 adjust highlight
		4 adjust shadow
		5 adjust whitebalance
		6 adjust contrast

		up enhance effect
		down diminish effect 
		left magnify the brush
		right shrink the brush
		n magnify the fading area
		m shrink the fading area

		w write to file
		s output mask image with the name masked.jpg
		u undo modification	
		o display original image 
		O display the current result image

	mouse
		push left button and brush the image to make the brush filter 

	
III.Code Structure:
	Userinter face: The behavior of keyboard and mouse are defined in main.cpp. 
	program resource management: The manager keeps track of the orginal image, the result image, and history images, as well as the an ImageProcess object that actually apply the ImageProcessing.
	Imageprocessing regionally: 
		1.User's mouse motion will be detected and analyse in main.cpp (mouse() MouseMotion())
		2.main call Manager::addBrushPaint(int x, inty) to modify the mask image.
		3.when mouse left button up motion detected, main call Manager::adjust(), to apply the adjustment;
		4.In Manager::adbrush(), different image processing function will be called based on the mode the manager currently on. For example, mode 1, dedicate that manager is about to change the brightness, so it ask ip to call ip.adjustBrightness(MyImage&, MyImage&, double); 
		5.All the adjustment function take alikely 3 parameter. First MyImage& is the reference to be process, Second MyImage& is a one channel mask image, Third one is the value for adjustment.
		6.In adjustment function, for each adjustment,  f()*(1+ value*area.data[y * area.width +x]) will be apply. area is the mask image.
		7.others
			1)file io: Mostly located in class FilIO, readFromFileToImage(MyImage& my, char* filename) to read, writeImageToFile(const MyImage& my, char* filename) to write.
			2)history Image: a vector of MyImage store the image every time adjust() is called in manager.
			3)glut resource : The  resource required by glut such as date to be displayed, windows size, are warpped into the an object of class resource.

VI.Attribution
	colorwindow.h is writen by Cem and J.Levine, I did some modification on it.
	Makefile is originally writen by DJ, I made some modification on it to fit this project.
