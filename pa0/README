Description:
This little program is the first programming assignment of 6040. What it dose is basically what is required in the assignment which are:
	a) reading and displaying the iamge
	b) flip the image vertically or horizontally
	c) display the single color channel of the image
	d) save what you see
	e) handle command line, keyboard and mouse action.

Usage:
	make
	./oiioview [inputfilename] [outputfilename]

[outputfilename] is optional.

Known bug:
	When display one channels greyscale image then save, it displays the original image instead of stay what it was before the image saving.

About Datastructure:
	The Datastructure I used to store an image is 3D vector, and 3 dangling global variable of extra information. (It turns out to be a bad idea to use vector.As I put them in a class, the vector tends to copy and copy and copy, it slows down the program a lot.)

Functional requirements:
Image Display: Function display() do the displaying. In function display(), glDrawpixel is called, display_data is the only buffer where glDrawpixel get its data from. In each loop, 
Reading Image: In function read_file(), data of an image are read in to a 3D vector.
Writing Image: Before the true file writing, the output_file buffer will be filled be data. Then the function write_to_file() is called;
Image Manipulation: I have exploited STL the do the flipping, just simply reverse lines or columns of the vector.
Command Line Behavior: arguments are handled in the first a few lines in main function.
Interaction: function handleKey and function handleMouseClick, these two will be called in every loop
