III.Code Structure:
Alphamask
	There are 4 classes in this program:
	Manager, handle argumets
	MyImage, the class we use to store image data, it member function over() takes in another MyImage object, cover over it, return the covering result.
	FileIO, read file into MyImage
	ImageProcess, process the MyImage. Currently has one member function which is setAlpha(). This function set alpha value for each pixel base on the input flag.

Composite
	Same classes are used as it in Alphamask. The rotine is quite straight forward,that is, it use FileIO to readin Images, then use the aforementioned member function "over()" of MyImage to composite a new image, then display the new image, or use FileIO to save it to new file.
