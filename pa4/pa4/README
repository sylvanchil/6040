I.Description:
This program finish all requirement in pa4. Experiments in experiments folder, new filter in the newfilter folder

II.Usage:
a)make
	make
b)run with normal filter
	./filt <filtfile> <imagefile> [outputfile]
or with gabor filter
	./filt -g <theta> <sigma> <period> <imagefile> [outputfile]

ps. <> is required, [] is optional, add "-t" to output file without displaying.

c)to generate experiment results, after make, run experiment.sh
	chmod +x experiment.sh
	./experiment.sh

III.Code Structure:
	There are 5 classes, they are Manager FileIO MyImage Filter ImageProcess.
		Manager		manage all resource including MyImage and Filter and ImageProcess. It also parse argument and interact with main function.
		FileIo 		read from file to modify a MyImage or a Filter.
		MyImage 	store data and properties of a image.
		Filter 		store data and properties of a Filter. 
		ImageProcess	 Process MyImage by using Filters.

	requirement:
		IO 			basically done by singleton class FileIO
		display, 	object of MyImage could output its data to desinated displayingbuffer
		convolve 	done by ImageProcess, in applyFilterTo(MyImage& m, Filter f) function.
		boundary, 	using reflection to handle boundary
		scaling, 	done when reading the Filter file.
		experiment, see the script, after running the script, the result will be stored in experiments folder
		new filter  see newfilter folder
		gaborfilter implemented in ImageProcess::applyGaborFilterto(), first, it generats a Filter, then call applyFilterTo().
		
IV.Attribution
	Makefile is originally writen by DJ, I made some modification on it to fit this project.
