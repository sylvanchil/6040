I.Description:
This program finish all requirement in pa5.

II.Usage:
a)make
	make
b)to run
	./tonemap sourceimage outputfilename [-g garma] [-c cvalue] [-b cvalue]

ps. <> is required, [] is optional, add "-t" to output file without displaying.
	
	when the program is running, use the following command
		key 's' to switch image
		key 'w' to write result to file, if no output filename is desinated, writing will fail ,error massage will be shown
		key 'q' or ESC to quit 

III.Code Structure:
	There are 5 classes, they are Manager FileIO MyImage Filter ImageProcess.
		Manager		manage all resource including MyImage and Filter and ImageProcess. It also parse argument and interact with main function.
		FileIo 		read from file to modify a MyImage or a Filter.
		MyImage 	store data and properties of a image.
		Filter 		store data and properties of a Filter. 
		ImageProcess	 Process MyImage by using Filters.

	requirement:
		IO 			basically done by singleton class FileIO
		display, 	object of MyImage could output its data to desinated displayingbuffer
		simpletonemap ImageProcess's member function simpletonemapping() 
		tonemap		ImageProcess's member function toneMappingWithConvolution()
		bilateral   ImageProcess's member function bilateralToneMapping()
	
VI.Attribution
	Makefile is originally writen by DJ, I made some modification on it to fit this project.
