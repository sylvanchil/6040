I.Description:
This program finish all requirements in pa6.

II.Usage:
a)make
	make
b)to run
	./warp imagename [outputimagename]

ps. <> is required, [] is optional, add "-t" to output file without displaying.
	
	when the program is running, use the following command
		r degree 	, to rotate
		s sx sy 	, to scaling image
		t tx ty 	, to translate image
		h hx hy 	, to shear image
		n s cx cy	, to twirl image
		d 	   		, to finish input

III.Code Structure:
	There are 5 classes, they are Manager FileIO MyImage Filter ImageProcess.
		Manager		manage all resource including MyImage and Filter and ImageProcess. It also parse argument and interact with main function.
		Resource 	contain resource required by GLUT, which are image width , image height , image channals , and data to be display.
		FileIo 		read from file to modify a MyImage or a Filter.
		MyImage 	store data and properties of a image.
		ImageProcess	 Process MyImage 

	requirement:
		IO 			basically done by singleton class FileIO
		display, 	object of MyImage could output its data to desinated displayingbuffer
		basic warping, a member funciton of ImageProcess , named inversedMapping does the job.
		twirl 		did not use the original twirl mapping formula or it inversion in the program, 
					using 	u = x*cos(a)+ y*sin(a)
							v = -x*sin(a)+ y*cos(a)
							a = strength(r - minDim)/minDim
					this is a derivation of the inversed twirl mapping formula, it does exactly the same thing as the original one does, just looks different.
	
VI.Attribution
	Makefile is originally writen by DJ, I made some modification on it to fit this project.
	Matrix and Vector implemented by Dr.house.
	main.cpp is partly from the template given in class.
