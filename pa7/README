I.Description:
This program finish all requirements in pa7.

II.Usage:
a)make
	make
b)to run
	./warp imagename [outputimagename] < in

ps. <> is required, [] is optional, add "-t" to output file without displaying.
	
	when the program is running, use the following command
		r degree 	, to rotate
		s sx sy 	, to scaling image
		t tx ty 	, to translate image
		h hx hy 	, to shear image
		n s cx cy	, to twirl image
		p px py		, perspective warp using px and py
		d 	   		, to finish input

III.Code Structure:
	There are 5 classes, they are Manager FileIO MyImage Filter ImageProcess.
		Manager		manage all resource including MyImage and Filter and ImageProcess. It also parse argument and interact with main function.
		Resource 	contain resource required by GLUT, which are image width , image height , image channals , and data to be display.
		FileIo 		read from file to modify a MyImage or a Filter.
		MyImage 	store data and properties of a image.
		ImageProcess	 Process MyImage 

	requirement:
		IO 			basically done by singleton class FileIO
		display, 	object of MyImage could output its data to desinated displayingbuffer
		warping,	a member funciton of ImageProcess , named inversedMapping does the job.
		repair, 	when calling function ImageProcess::inversedMapping() with flag 1,as the third parameter, the repair would be done.
		supersampling 
					for each pixel(x,y), take 9 sample (x-0.33, y-0.33), 
					(x, y-0.33),(x+0.33, y-0.33),(x-0.33, y),(x, y),
					(x+0.33, y),(x-0.33,y+0.33),(x,y+0.33),(x+0.33,y+0.33)
					then apply inversedMapping then bilinear iterpolation on them.
					finally use the average value of them as the finally value.

VI.Attribution
	Makefile is originally writen by DJ, I made some modification on it to fit this project.
	Matrix and Vector implemented by Dr.house.
	main.cpp is partly from the template given in class.
